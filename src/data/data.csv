quote
"Live for today, build for tomorrow"
"No time to waste, no time to hate"
Shine on
"Stay unproblematic, age flawless"
Zen as fuck
Everything you put in will be multiplied
Go your own way
Petty is never pretty
Your opportunities are endless
"Energy is precious, don't spend it defending lies"
Why correct others? Karma will do it better
Your dreams are about to come true
Believe in the good
Ignore the bullshit
"Baby girl, you are 💯"
"Always take the high road, the views are better"
"If it feels shady, leave"
"It will all make sense in the end. If it doesn't, it's not the end"
Trust your gut
"Work on yourself, daily"
Stay curious
Don't let one bad apple ruin the bunch
Miscalculations refine your trajectory
The truth always comes to light
