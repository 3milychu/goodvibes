quote
"Live for today, build for tomorrow"
"No time to waste, no time to hate"
Shine on
"Stay unproblematic, age flawless"
Zen as fuck
Everything you put in will be multiplied
Go your own way
Petty is never pretty
Your opportunities are endless
"Energy is precious, don't spend it defending lies"
Why correct others? Karma will do it better
Your dreams are about to come true
Believe in the good
Ignore the bullshit
"Baby girl, you are 💯"
"Always take the high road, the views are better"
"If it feels shady, let go without regret"
"It will all make sense in the end. If it doesn't, it's not the end"
Trust your gut
Work on yourself daily
Stay curious
Don't let one bad apple ruin the bunch
Miscalculations refine your trajectory
The truth always comes to light
"Bitterness corrodes, acceptance glows"
Your passions look like a billion dollars
"Unhappy people fear what's beyond them, happy people reach for the unknown"
Practice your morals everyday
"Pick yourself up, lift others high, praise your enemies, spread goodwill"
"At the end of the day, wash yourself clean"
Start each day with joy in your eyes
Find peace in the little moments
Remember who you are
Never apologize for loving fiercely
Do things for the right reasons only
Forward movement only
Patience will reward you beyond your imagination
Take care of the vulnerable
Teach those younger than you about hope
Teach those older than you about selflessness
Teach yourself about why good people do hurtful things
Let go with consideration
"If it's painful, it was worth it"
Laugh freely
You can find humor in any situation
Look! This is a sign that you're on the right track
"Yes, you can"
